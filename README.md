# Docker Composer

Docker Composer is a lightweight, browser-based tool to generate Docker Compose files easily. It allows users to select popular Dockerized applications, configure options like ports, volumes, environment variables, and restart policies, and instantly see a live preview of the resulting `docker-compose.yml`. Once configured, the file can be downloaded or copied with a single click.

## Features

- Interactive web interface (no downloads required)
- Live preview of generated `docker-compose.yml`
- Easy configuration of ports, volumes, environment variables, and restart policies
- Templates for popular Docker services (e.g., Jellyfin)
- Copy or download the final Docker Compose file

## Getting Started
